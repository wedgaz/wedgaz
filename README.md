👋 Hi,
I'm Eric from Belize; 46 and trying to learn programming.
I only finished high school and am so very not tech savvy...this is and will be an overwhelming journey.
However! I have faith...and a whole bunch of free resources on the web. Thanks to all who made, and those who are still making this possible👌🙏.
So, I'll just be around hanging on until I prove that I can still learn somethings worthwhile.
Peace and love braddaz and sistaz...
